# IPA Glyph

Each component instance is used to modify a glyph in the pronunciation.

When the user clicks on a glyph, then a popup menu shows up that allows the user to pick a similar
ipa glyph. If they want a totally different glyph, then they click a button at the bottom of the
list to open a modal with all glyphs available.
